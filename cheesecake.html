        <h1>Cheese Cake</h1>
        <h3>What you'll need: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ cups Honey Maid Graham Cracker Crumbs</li>
            <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups sugar, divided</li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages Philadelphia Cream Cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup Breakstone's or Knudsen Sour Cream</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Let&apos;s make it:</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix graham crumbs, butter, and 1/4 cup sugar together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Press crumbs onto bottom of 9-inch springform pan.</li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese and remaining sugar in large bowl with mixer until blended. 
                Add sour cream and vanilla; mix well.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed after each addition just until blended.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture over crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, about 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. 
                Run knife around rim of pan to loosen cake; cool before removing rim. Refrigerate cheesecake 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Top with pie filling before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Kitchen Tips:</h3>
        <p>When cutting creamy-textured desserts, such as cheesecake, carefully wipe off the knife blade between 
            cuts with a clean damp towel. This prevents the creamy filling from building up on the blade, ensuring 
            nice clean cuts that leave the filling intact.</p>
