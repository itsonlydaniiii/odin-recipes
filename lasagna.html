        <h3>Kitchen Tips:</h3>
        <p>Size Wise<br/>
            Since this comfort-food classic serves 12, it&apos;s the perfect dish to serve at your next large 
            gathering of family or friends.<br/><br/>
            
            Note<br/>
            The noodles will expand as the lasagna bakes to fill the baking dish.
            <br/><br/>
            Variation<br/>
            Prepare using extra-lean ground beef, and substituting 2 egg whites for the whole egg.
            <br/><br/>
            Note<br/>
            Adding water to the sauce helps cook the traditional noodles during baking so you don&apos;t have to cook 
            them beforehand. This saves you 15 to 20 minutes of prep time.</p>
